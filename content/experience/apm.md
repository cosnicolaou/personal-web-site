APM managed a research consortium under the EU's Esprit programme in the early 90's that was broadly
focused on distributed systems and related standardisation efforts (ISO RM-ODP). The work and team were really
very good in my opinion and I was foruntate enough to work on the multimedia aspects of the project
as well as the software product ANSAworks. You can download ANSAworks <a href="/downloads/ANSAware4_1_1_tar.gz" download>here</a>;
for 5MB you get a name server and RPC system written in C that with a bit of work could be updated to run on Linux
rather than the 1990s vintage UNIX systems it was developed on. The reports are available courtesy of the
[Computer Conservation Society](http://www.computerconservationsociety.org) [here](http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/ansa/).
[Andy Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Herbert) was the project
lead and along with [Joe Sventek](https://cs.uoregon.edu/profile/jsventek), Dave Otway and many others
provided an excellent 'first job' environment. ANSAworks was most notably used for the NASA
[NASA Astropyhics Data System (ADS)](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1992ASPC...25...35G&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf) in the early 1990s and for Olivetti Research [Active Badge System](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/ab.html).
