My PhD work was in the area of distributed systems and multimedia communications, all of which is so
commonplace today that it's hard to believe that was ever a research area! The actual dissertation
is [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-191.html) though apparently it's only available
on paper and I've somehow lost the original source code for it (this is not a great loss).
There was another publication in the Journal of Selected Areas of Communication (JSAC) that's available as a Computer Lab
[report](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-220.html).

Again, the UK has a very different approach to PhD programmes than the US, with research students working primarily on their
research and not on a project or for their supervisor or for the university. Consequently the expectation is that you
can finish within 3 years, though most people take 4.
