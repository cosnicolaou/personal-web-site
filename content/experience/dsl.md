DSL was my first attempt at consulting and I spent most of that time working
for [Olivetti Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Research_Laboratory)
on low level device drivers for video display hardware and ATM ALL5 network drivers.
These were developed on the first generation of DEC's [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha) based machines and
the first version of the [OSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Software_Foundation) based Ultrix (DEC's version of UNIX). It was a pretty rough ride since we needed
to DMA to/from user-space and the VM system was mostly undocumented and
somewhat unreliable at first. We eventually managed to get good
performance for the networked video; running at full-frame and resolution
(NTSC/PAL) over the network with very little buffering in 1993 was pretty
impressive.
