In early 1993 I became one of the founders of Nemesys Research which developed
and marketed networked attached video codecs. There were two
[boxes](/images/ava-atv.jpg), one the AVA was an encoder, the other the ATV
the decoder pair. They were used for the obvious video distribution application,
but also for CCTV and video conferencing.
We built a fairly complete voice-directed conference mixer/echo canceller and
associated software. It all worked pretty well but was too expensive (approximately
$2000 per box) and we didn't move quickly enough to drive down the costs.

I worked mostly on the control and management software, including workstation
video/audio playback as well as the usual 'founder' stuff including be
an amateur sales person, even more amateur accountant and everything else
that goes into running a small business.

My full-time co-founder was Joe Dixon, but Ian Pratt and Paul Barham built the
first version of the AVA as research students at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory
under the supervision of Ian Leslie and Derek McAuley. You may recognise
[Ian Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Pratt_(computer_scientist)) since he later went to on to create Xen and XenSource.

We sold Nemesys to FORE Systems in November of 1996 and continued to develop
the AVA/ATV product line until the summer of 1999. At which point I moved to
the US to work for FORE Systems in the Bay Area.

Overall it was an excellent experience and my only regret is that it came
"too early" in my career for me to make the most of it. Given the same
set of people and circumstances 20 years on I'm sure we could have made into
a huge business.
