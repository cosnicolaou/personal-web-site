In early 1993 I became one of the founders of Nemesys Research which developed
and marketed networked attached video codecs. There were two [boxes](/images/ava-atv.jpg), one the AVA
was an encoder, the other the ATV the decoder pair. They were used for the
obvious video distribution application, but also for CCTV and video conferencing.
We built a fairly complete voice-directed conference mixer/echo canceller and
associated software. It all worked pretty well but was too expensive (approximately
$2000 per box) and we didn't move quickly enough to drive down the costs.

My full-time co-founder was Joe Dixon, but Ian Pratt and Paul Barham built the
first version of the AVA as research students at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory
under the supervision of Ian Leslie and Derek McAuley. You may recognise
[Ian Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Pratt_(computer_scientist)) since he later went to on to create Xen and XenSource.
