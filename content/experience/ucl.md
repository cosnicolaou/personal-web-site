Degree courses in the United Kingdom are, or at least in the 80's were, very focused on the major and optional minor.
This three year course consisted of 3 terms per year with 4 classes per term, each of about 5 hours per week in
CS, with some classes offered by the math and electrical engineering deparments. The only class that I feel was missing
(or more likely I missed) was an advanced probability and statistics class which would have been much more
useful than the advanced calculus classes. Even the APL class had some value.

I started out taking a joint major in CS and EE but realised after the first year that I enjoyed the CS much more than analog AC circuits!
The only person I recall taking both and doing well was [Mike Burrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burrows).
